"Finley should’ve been happier — he should’ve been beaming out there on the hardwood. At seventeen he had a car, a job, and a girlfriend.

"Inside a Belizean cave, you wade deeper into green water in search of Xibalba, the underworld. Alone—save for the snakes and cave crickets—you put on a miner’s lamp and begin to explore the murky Sibun River. You stumble and swallow a large gulp of water and spit out the muddy, gritty aftertaste. When you recover, you ease into a pair of flippers and move farther along the cave’s meandering tunnels. | © Brian L. Tucker"
"Sophie had forgotten him by then. Not completely, he would have returned eventually, but enough for now. It would surprise her how easy it had been to forget, as if her body had ignored a wound. At no precise moment, some kind helper in her mind had draped a sheet over the pain. Let it be for now, she doesn’t have to see it tonight. It was not going anywhere today, and in some ways never would, so let her rest for now, let it be. And there it would have lain all night, until she lay in bed waiting for sleep, if there had not been one final scene to play. | © Thomas Rooney"
"She is a nameless woman with unicorn skin, bearing purple and pink scars that bleed into an ashen sky. Her eyes pulse with the spectral grit and oil of yesterday’s brutality. As pain boils, it sears open a distant heaven, as real as her life, now exhausted, as a kingdom waits, seated on a throne in her mind. At the moment, a giant orb expands and contracts exultingly above her diminishing body, blinding white with cruel, descending compassion. | © Stephanie Flood"
"The city’s planners and designers wanted to name it Utopia, but soon realized, the project would not be considered if they did. So, it was named Glory and it truly was glorious. Nin was born into this perfect city, with its perfect buildings, perfect people and where virtually everything was simply…perfect. The only problem was, Nin was not perfect. Nin was the one in 10,000 born with deformities that seemed to baffle modern medicine. Try as they may, the medical community was not able, or not willing, to explain the two nubs that should have been Nin’s legs. Therefore, when Nin was born, they quickly removed the infant from the delivery room. A city official rushed in to explain how sorry the city was, and that the city would accept all responsibility for this less than perfect child. The grieving couple was moved to the head of the birthing queue and life quickly returned to the glorious norm. Before long, the couple produced another child, perfect in every way. | © W.A. Fix"

"On the shores of the swamp, two teenagers fell in love during the twilight of an autumn night. He kicked off his shoes and rolled up his pants; she slid from her sandals and held the hem of her dress in her right hand. There were grimy jars underneath the back steps of the house. He unscrewed the lids and handed her one. She let go of the hem of her dress, and they waded into the water together. Dashing through the shallows, they caught an odd dozen of fireflies. After releasing their catch, he brushed a stray hair behind her ear and kissed her for the first time. | © Laura Konrad"

"The city had not gone to sleep, as there are very few cities left in the world that still sleep and those that do aren’t frequented. Nevertheless, the city was as near to sleep as it ever would be, and thus our story begins. The sky, beyond the thick layer of smog and the even thicker layer of fog and a slightly less thick but nonetheless significant layer of cloud from which rain plummeted, was black with a plethora of stars in various arrangements. Some said they could see a spoon, a bear, or even a warrior in these stars, but truly there were no utensils or animals or people of any occupation in the sky. People just liked to add meaning to the random scatterings, so we let them name the stars’ shapes and enjoy the constellations when they can see them, which isn’t often for our city dwellers. | © Kristan Melo"

In spite of this problem, Nagesh turned out to be a good-looking fellow, albeit a little frail, with a head full of dark curly hair. He was by no means a ruggedly handsome six footer and broad shouldered. He was what some girls called cute. When he heard that a hot babe in his college called him cute, he was devastated, and assumed he had no chance with that beautiful damsel.

"Once he completed his engineering degree, like many of his peers, Deepak prepared to go to America for graduate studies. His parents felt that if they let Deepak go to U.S.A. all by himself, he might be lured into a dangerous liaison by a beef-eating Christian girl. So they began the search for a suitable girl in and around Hyderabad. Since Deepak was dark, short, and puny, many prospective brides weren’t impressed. When it became crystal clear that the modern girls in the Hyderabad metro area weren’t keen on Deepak, a much wider net was cast, and a suitable girl was located in Kakinada, a small town in coastal Andhra Pradesh. The prim and proper Usha had beady eyes, bushy eyebrows, and fine hairs on her chin and upper lip and was obviously not in a position to reject Deepak. | © Rudy Ravindra"

He’s quietly horrified by the lack of butterflies and come to think of it, the bees too. Where have all the insects and creatures gone my friends? Far far away. It’s a kind of subtle massacre that’s going on he concludes, brewing tea before the day starts. Insidious really. And this damage mostly invisible but it builds up in land and in people; things you just cannot airbrush out of existence.

"“Mommy when can we have a Doggie?” I have lost count of all the times my kiddos have asked me this question. Every time my heart says “yes very soon”, but my mind asks them to wait for the right time. I try to evade the question and change the course of our conversation to other lucrative subjects like which movie would they like to watch over the weekend, or what candy would they want to add to the grocery list this time. It’s very easy to distract them. But sometimes I give in and we talk about Dogs. Usually it starts with my recital of the basic commandments of owning a dog. And that’s to make sure that they know exactly what they would be getting into. They might think that it’s like picking a toy from the toy store, but they should understand that they can’t put it away in the bin when the playtime is over. It is like bringing a new baby in the world. It’s a big responsibility and commitment for life. It’s like welcoming a new relationship, even while knowing that it’s going to hurt you like crazy when it ends. This inevitable pain which comes with the package sometimes makes me look for excuses. But most of the time the pros make the cons look smaller and manageable. And the child within me makes it 3 to 1 in favor of a doggie pal for the family. | © Deepali Patil"

"Despite an icy northeast wind huffing across the bay I sneak out after dark, after my mother falls asleep clutching her leather Bible, and I hike up the rutted road to the frosted meadow to stand in mist, my shoes in muck, and toss my echo against the moss-covered fieldstone corners of the burned-out church where Sunday nights in summer for years Father Thomas, that mad handsome priest, would gather us girls in the basement to dye the rose cotton linen cut-outs that the deacon’s daughter, a thin beauty with short white hair and long trim nails, would stitch by hand each folded edge then steam-iron flat so full of starch, stiffening fabric petals, which we silly Sunday school girls curled with quick sharp pulls of a scissor blade, forming clusters of curved petals the younger children assembled with Krazy glue and fuzzy green wire, sometimes adding tissue paper leaves, all of us gladly laboring like factory workers rather than have to color with crayon stubs the robe of Christ again, Christ with his empty hands inviting us to dine, Christ with a shepherd’s staff signaling to another flock of puffy lambs, or naked Christ with a drooping head crowned with blackened thorns, and Lord how we laughed later when we went door to door in groups, visiting the old parishioners, the sick and bittersweet, all the near dead, and we dropped our bikes on the perfect lawns of dull neighbors, agnostics we suspected, hawking our handmade linen roses for a donation, bragging how each petal was hand-cut from a pattern drawn by Father Thomas himself, that mad handsome priest, who personally told the Monsignor to go fornicate himself, saying he was a disgruntled altar boy calling home from a phone booth outside a pub in North Dublin, while I sat half-dressed, sniffing incense, giddy and drunk with sacrament wine stains on my panties, whispering my oath of unholy love while wiggling uncomfortably on the mad priest’s lap, but God he was beautiful with a fine chiseled chin and perfect teeth and a smile that would melt the Madonna, and God he was kind with a slow gentle touch, never harsh or too quick, and Christ how that crafty devil could draw, imitate a rose petal in perfect outline, his sharp pencil slanted just so, the tip barely touching so that he could sketch and drink, and cough without jerking, without ruining the work, or tearing the tissue paper, thin as a membrane, which like a clean skin arrived fresh each Saturday delivered by the dry cleaners, tucked into the crisp black vestment, wrapped around shirt cardboard, pinned to protect the high collar. | © Bob Thurber"

Like you have spent your entire life walking around with your eyes shaded by a translucent curtain, and then one day, they are reopened like a shot of adrenaline straight to the heart. I wonder if we ever truly see things, even as a child. Like a new born seeing its mother’s breast for the first time. No, I don’t think we ever really care to see anything for what it truly is, until our eyes are awakened by the foresight of never seeing anything again. I think a man born without sight sees more with one simple touch of the hand then we do our entire lives. Sure, I suppose we see a lot, but do we ever stop to realize what we’re seeing? To let it sink in to our over developed alien brains? I think not. We are too busy rushing to our early graves to stop and “listen” to what we are actually seeing. | © Billy Mundane"

He was very rich, famous and very, very talented. However, it was all overshadowed by his love of the game and he truly believed that football was what he was born to do. He was right. | © W.A. Fix"
"The page had been staring back at him for days now, the little cursor stripe blinking its patient interval. This did not even come close to reflecting Chris’ mood at the moment. For the first time in his glorious writing career he was struck with that agitating indecisiveness. The sixth (and final) volume of his best-selling fantasy series was coming to a close and the extremely popular lead character, a farmer’s son who had been set on a marvelous journey through time, was about to meet his demise. The previous sentences had prepared the reader for it. Everybody would know what was coming. All that remained was the sequence of words that would deliver the tragic news, most likely triggering tears amongst the more sensitive readers. This fate had been planned since the very start of the series, yet now that the moment had come, Chris could not follow through with it. Over the years, so much of his soul, of his experiences, had been poured into these pages. Killing his character felt not only like killing his loving child…it felt like killing a part of himself. | © Martin Hooijmans"

"She was one of those people who entered a room belly first — a quality you might associate with a reluctant, if not particularly shameful concession to the sloth of middle age.

"He closed the gate behind him and cast one final glance at his girlfriend, staring at him from behind another series of bars that served as the second line of defense. It felt to him as if he was literally in a prison, only able to look at her, and nothing else. No touch. The public did not allow it, which weighed heavily here. It weighed heavily on them. As always when he said goodbye for the night, he could see it in her eyes. The anxiety to fly into his arms, the lust to rip the clothes from his body. But it could not be. | © Martin Hooijmans"

"Once he completed his engineering degree, like many of his peers, Deepak prepared to go to America for graduate studies. His parents felt that if they let Deepak go to U.S.A. all by himself, he might be lured into a dangerous liaison by a beef-eating Christian girl. So they began the search for a suitable girl in and around Hyderabad. Since Deepak was dark, short, and puny, many prospective brides weren’t impressed. When it became crystal clear that the modern girls in the Hyderabad metro area weren’t keen on Deepak, a much wider net was cast, and a suitable girl was located in Kakinada, a small town in coastal Andhra Pradesh. The prim and proper Usha had beady eyes, bushy eyebrows, and fine hairs on her chin and upper lip and was obviously not in a position to reject Deepak. | © Rudy Ravindra"

It looks like a photo booth narrower than a confessional. I didn’t want to try it but go first. I demand your five dollars, which you give. After five bright snaps of coma the camera is printing a time traveler. What we didn’t know was that a photo collection is pre-programmed to appear as a backdrop, with one image as fill-in background. There I am, 80 years old. The computer program describes my face as an ancient rancher. It’s all there: my dirty Wrangler jeans, work boots, buttoned-to-the-collar work shirt, even my ragged bandana. The program has mistaken my glasses for dark-lensed wind goggles, but the face is mine. Even the hair grown to a tangled wiry silver hanging limp to the shoulders is somehow mine.

"For years Rocky’s Diner had always done a great business for breakfast and lunch but his dinner business had fallen off recently as folks moved to the suburbs, got married, died or simply went elsewhere to eat. He thought about closing early but he had a small cadre of elderly men, many of whom had been his customers for two or three meals a day, and Rocky didn’t know where else they might go to eat. They were all single now for different reasons—divorced, widowed, never married or deserted by a wife who had become fed up. Most were in their late 70s and early 80s and not renowned for their civility. They were a crotchety bunch but Rocky liked them all. He himself was in his late 60s, happily married, and didn’t have to worry about money, thanks in large part to loyal customers like these elderly men, some of whom had been eating at his diner for decades. | © Donal Mahoney"
"I hid behind a rock as the eyes of my brothers scanned the frozen park for my battered body. The moon had set three times, sleep came but I chased it away and my wings had been plucked so as to ground me for a period of thirty one days.

Our love was the reason I was cast out of paradise for he was my charge and I was his guardian. | © Sonya Watson"

Contemplating that decision and imagining where on her body she could have it placed so that ten years down the road it wouldn’t be sagging or wrinkly. Heck, where on her body could she put it NOW that it wouldn’t look distorted in some way. Right upper breast? Top of her foot? Should it be right side up to her view or the view of others if she chose placement on her slender foot? Too many variables. Variables that might ruin the art. Were tattoos just art?

"The King of the World was sitting on his throne and looked at his subjects with boredom and something which might have been anger. Three velvet cushions were piled up under his royal backside so that he was tall enough to look his admirers in the eye. Why were these unusual measures necessary, you might wonder. It was because the King of the World was only ten years old. His late father bent his head into the yoke of marriage quite late, so when his first son, King of the World Junior, at that time simply Harry, was born the father was already on the shady side of fifty. Then, his 63rd took him away, leaving the throne and two screaming twin sisters to Junior. | © Fanni Sütő"

"It was when my mum left that the trouble started. I knew mum and dad were making each other sad. Phoebe at school said she knew when her mum and dad didn’t love each other too, and that’s what I knew. I think my brother Mikey and I had known for ages, we just didn’t say. We didn’t talk about it much, but sometimes we did. We would go in the airing cupboard with a packet of biscuits he had probably stolen from the treats cupboard and we promised we’d stay together when they got divorced. It was obvious that something would have to happen. All the screaming at night. All the banging doors and thrown ashtrays that left a dent in the wall the next morning. We just knew. | © Tamsin Hopkins"

"The truck’s tailpipe shook with steamy exhaust as the truck idled there between the several multi-storied and peach-colored stucco maintenance buildings. Twisted, drooping live oaks, charcoal against the fading indigo sky and dripping with Spanish moss, lined the white sand-mixed-with-oyster shell road leading in. A middle-aged man sat behind the steering wheel and smoked a cigarette, waiting, flicking ashes out the open driver’s side window every few puffs. Then another man emerged from a nearby building, a bolt-action .22 rifle in one hand, a half-peeled banana in the other. He walked up alongside the truck, hooked an elbow over the bed and then pulled the rest of him up over the edge using the rear tire as a step. Once inside the bed, he stood behind the cab, legs spread, leaning forward to rest his waist against the back window with one hand to hold the banana and the other pressing the rifle’s buttstock into his hip. He gave a shout and then the truck started off, carving a circle through the sand before following the road out until it sank into shadows of live oaks and palmettos, leaving only a veil of dust and murmur of distant truck engine in its wake. | © Erich Earl Forschler"

She is there smiling prettily from the corners of her mouth when he goes to fill his bowl from the serving plates in the dining hall, she is there looking up shyly from beneath her lashes when he lines up for roll call in the courtyard and she is there discretely swaying her hips as she walks daintily when he marches from the old mill to the farm to work away the days in a haze of summer routine. But mostly she is in his head. He cannot decipher his thoughts of her, are they simply the urges of a man long away at war, a man locked away from natural urges? Or is it more than that? Something tells him only she can fill the unmet need that sits heavy within his closed-up heart. She is young of course, still just a child in many ways, he guesses she is 16 but to him, she is a woman. | © Carla Dow"

I never understood what he was talking about. He would go on for hours at a time, speaking of how he grew up on a farm and that his father hunted to put food on the table. He smiled as he spoke of his father, telling me how special the man had been. I could always hear the reverence my father had in his voice whenever he spoke of my grandfather. | © Timothy Reilly"

"Standing in the middle of the Tres Estrellas Bus Terminal in Matamoros, Tina clenched her jaws. She was so pissed. For starters Roberto, the dude she’d come with for a supposedly really cool vacation in Mexico, had turned out to be a jerk. At the Popeye’s Fried Chicken where Tina worked he’d come in late at night and flirted with her for the past month. Not many guys paid that kind of attention to her. No she wasn’t the Hollywood glamour type, but golly, she had a great personality. She’d won Fry Cook of the Month twice. Now that she’d been full time with Popeye’s for three years she qualified for a week’s vacation. He’d been sweet and he’d talked her into this trip with him. “I speak their lingo, Tina and I can tell you Mexico is paradise just a day away. And Tina, wouldn’t I love to be your gentleman tour guide. Show you the exotic, Tina — that’s what I wanna do, show you the exotic, hon. How ‘bout it? You buy the bus tickets. We can stay at my Uncle’s motel in Monterrey — completely free. Hey, if you can find a better deal go for it.” He brought her a magazine article showing lush gardens, beautiful hotels, and cliff divers in Aculpulco. Well, it’d sounded really good then. The bus tickets to Brownsville, Texas had cost $296.00. This was Tina’s big adventure and it’s all she could think about for the week before her vacation started. | © Gary Ives"

"The doors of the bus swung open with a nasty creak. Harry was used to it. He endured the sound six days a week, eight hours a day for what seemed like an eternity to him. His eyes darted constantly to the little calendar in the corner of the window, dimly illuminated by the street lights outside. It showed a picture of the image many people his age held in their heads: a luxury cottage on a Spanish beach. The difference between Harry and most of these people was that he had actually managed to obtain one, in fact, the very one he was now admiring. “Five more days.”, he thought to himself. Yes, five more and he would be a free man, liberated from bus number 6V. People asked him if he would miss it, but he always shrugged and shook his head. With the promise of a retirement in the Spanish sun he doubted he would miss anything about this city. His wife would come with him, his kids were long gone, scattered in all directions of the wind. And friends, well, he could always make new ones, right? No more grime, no more crime, no more sirens twenty-four hours a day. It was a change Harry had cherished for countless years. In his eyes, all decency had left this city long ago. Time he went chasing after it. | © Martin Hooijmans"

"In the late nineteenth century, the well-to-do village of Slapbutox-on-Hynde was keen to enhance its image as a thriving community in which well being and prosperity were to be linked to nature and the aesthetic.

As a master of the elements, fear was his tactic, magic his weapon. On some days he would be benevolent, and bless his skinny farmers with a flow of rich waters to nourish the land. On others, he would send all-destroying hurricanes, fill the fields with rocks that attacked anyone who tried to remove them or simply send an inferno that incinerated entire harvests. Yes, his people lived in fear. | © Martin Hooijmans"

"“I can’t quite recall the moment it began, it just seemed to seep upon us like a rising floodwater or noxious gas. War crept up on us and only when it was fixed in our lives, did it announce its presence.” | © Carla Dow"
"Nikola Cooper was an extremely well-travelled young lady. She’d laid her head on the comfiest pillows of the finest Parisian hotels, spent entire nights with no sleep whilst camping through electrical storms in the sweltering Australian desert, and had paid a Cambodian fruit seller just $1 to share a windowless room with his two dogs. However, no matter where Nikola had been in the world, she had never come across a member of staff as rude as the chambermaid at the Olive Tree Apartments on the Greek island of Corfu. | © Daniel Henshaw"
There are twelve rifles. Eleven contain a live round. A blank cartridge is in one. You have no way of knowing which resides in the weapon you are given. | © Joe Kilgore
"Phil was the kind of man who loved fire. He loved the way it looked, the way it felt, the way it crackled. He couldn’t get enough of it. | © Martin Hooijmans"
"Dear Mom… You were sure right about the foliage. The New Haven Green is ablaze with multi-colored trees and the constant changing hues made me want to draw or paint them so I bought a small colored pencil kit and have included a couple of sketches. Hope they’re not too abstract for your liking. I’m also taking photos of the trees and have purposely blurred them so shapes don’t interfere with the colors. It’s starting to get chilly here now so I’m glad you had me pack those sweaters. I remember that this is the best weather in the Bay Area. I guess autumn (you always call it fall) is the best season on both coasts. Too bad I won’t be seeing you for Thanksgiving, I was looking forward to it; but if you say you’re physically and mentally exhausted and need the rest who am I to argue?

Mark parked his BMW in his garage like he normally did. He took off his shoes and loosened his tie in the laundry room like he normally did. And he called out his girlfriend’s name like he normally did. | © Allen Gorney
"Three hours after he shot him, he had a breakfast at the Waffle House. It was four in the morning, still cold and wet. Jake finished off his glass of milk and slid it forward. “I shouldn’t have done that,” he said. | © Bob Skoggins"

"The Summer Holidays were over. From his vantage point, little shovel in hand, Jimmy could see his parents loading the car with all belongings they had brought to the beach house, his included. Somehow, after two weeks of heated discussion, mom and dad were still convinced their young son would accompany them home. Jimmy saw no single reason why he should, though. Home meant school, chores, bullies, and a whole assortment of additional things he disliked. Here, on the beach, he could live in his palace, enjoying not a care in the world. | © Martin Hooijmans"
"As a life long gardener Patrick knows there’s something freakish about the summer he’s living through right now, 2013. Why isn’t it reaching headline news he fumes quietly, laying fresh fruit, vegetables and flowers in front of the Edingthorpe village shop as he he’s done for twenty five years. He’s quietly horrified by the lack of butterflies and come to think of it, the bees too. Where have all the insects and creatures gone my friends? Far far away. It’s a kind of subtle massacre that’s going on he concludes, brewing tea before the day starts. Insidious really. And this damage mostly invisible but it builds up in land and in people; things you just cannot airbrush out of existence. It’s July and gentle breezes cause wheat and barley crops to sway gently in the flat Norfolk fields. Sheppy, Patrick’s sheep dog, played up earlier in the drive back from nearby town North Walsham but he’s dozing peacefully now outside the shop’s front. | © Sarah Guppy"
