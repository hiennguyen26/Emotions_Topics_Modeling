Abstract

Sentiment recognition and analysis is a growing area in multi-disciplinary research that has become increasingly popular in recent years. It is especially valuable in assessing public attitudes such as in customer service areas, in monitoring brand and product sentiments from customer feedback, and can also be used to assess sentiments surrounding different marketing campaigns. Especially with a constant phenomenon of information overload online, the role of sentiment analysis models is more crucial to provide a quick overview of public opinions. This paper discusses application of LDA topic modeling, particularly HDP-LDA, and explores Naive Bayes methods for emotion analysis and the preprocessing needed for these models. The goal of the exercise is to visualize a network graph by separating nodes into emotions and sub-nodes into topics of different interests. The experiment was proven to be successful as both models were able to predict a various number of topics that could be sorted across many types of emotions. This paper can be considered as a foundational step for further experimental refinement to get more accurate results in sorting random texts into emotions and topics.
